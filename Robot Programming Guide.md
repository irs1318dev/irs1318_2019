## Overview
> "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." - Albert Einstein

The Issaquah Robotics Society’s Robot code is designed to be a good example of a moderately large software project that students of varying levels of experience with programming can contribute to.  It is aimed at making the programming of the robot easy, so that it can respond well to changes to the physical robot as well as changes in the way that we wish to control the robot.  It achieves this by encapsulating each part in a different area of the code, with the idea that there should be very little duplication of code to ease maintainability.

## General Robot Design
Robots in FRC tend to have a small set of different pieces that we want to utilize, that can be arranged in a large number of ways to make complex mechanisms.  These mechanisms are designed before the code for them is written, so you should know what they are composed of by the time you are writing any code.  I’ll list out a few of these pieces here and explain what they do and how we typically use them.

### RoboRIO
RoboRIO is the name of the computing device that is used to control the robot.  It is produced by National Instruments and runs a customized version of Linux on an ARM processor.  We write code that uses a library called WPILib to handle interactions between the Robot, Driver Station, etc.

### Actuators
#### Motors (Talons, Jaguars, Victors)
Electric motors are typically used to provide movement for the robot.  They provide a rotational force that is dependent on the current setting on them and the amount of voltage that is available.  Motors are useful when a certain amount of motion is needed or when there are motions that need to happen at different speeds (as opposed to all-or-nothing).  Motors are used in places such as drive trains, elevators, and intakes.  In WPILib, they are controlled using a double value (rational number) between -1.0 and 1.0.  Since 2018, we have typically used the Talon SRX which can incorporate the abilities of a motor, an encoder, a top/bottom limit switch, and a PID controller.

#### Pistons/Pneumatic Cylinders (DoubleSolenoids)
Pneumatic cylinders are also used to provide movement for components on the robot.  They provide a lateral force and are controlled very simply by a set of 2 valves (solenoids) that change where air pressure is directed in order to move the rod within the cylinder.  There are 3 settings: "off" which means that no air pressure is applied through either valve, "forward" which means that air pressure is applied through one valve, and "reverse" which means that air pressure is applied through the other valve.  Forward and Reverse typically correlates to whether the piston is actively pushing out or actively pulling in, but it depends on how the pneumatics are set up.  Due to the way that they work, pneumatics controlled by solenoids trigger all-or-nothing movements.  Solenoids are often used in "shooters", such as the kicker on the 2016 robot.  In WPILib, they are controlled using settings of Value.kOff, Value.kForward, and Value.kReverse.

### Sensors
#### Limit Switches
Limit switches are simple switches that are used to sense when two things are physically touching.  They are simple electronic devices that complete a circuit (or break a circuit) when the switch is pressed, and break a circuit (or complete it) when released.  In WPILib, you would use a DigitalInput, which returns a true or false based on whether the limit switch is pressed or not.

#### Encoders
Encoders are used to measure the amount that an axle has rotated.  There are different types of encoders, but we typically use a quadrature encoder.  These encoders can detect the amount of rotation and the direction in which the axle has rotated.  Each encoder has a rating for how many "pulses" or ticks it receives in a complete rotation of the axle.  Using some simple math based on the sizes of the wheels (and gears), you can calculate how far something has travelled.  In WPILib, you would use an Encoder object, which returns the number of ticks/pulses, the distance (based on the distance per pulse), or the velocity (if you trust the timer on the robot).

#### Through-Beam Sensors
Through-Beam Sensors are simple infrared sensors and lights that are used to sense whether there is anything between the light and sensor.  They are often used in the real world at the bottom of a garage door to detect if anything is under the garage door so it doesn’t get crushed.  This can be used on a robot to sense whether something is in a given spot.  We used one on the 2015 robot to detect whether any tote was contained within the intake in a proper place to be picked up by the robot’s elevator.  In WPILib, you would use an AnalogInput, which returns a double value (rational number) which indicates how many volts were detected by the infrared sensor.  This value will differ based on the through-beam sensor, so you can tell through experimentation whether it is tripped or not.

#### Distance Sensors
There are various types of distance sensors, which can use either sound or light to sense how far away the robot is from something else.  In WPILib, you would use an AnalogInput, which would return a double value (rational number) which indicates how many volts were detected by the sensor.  This value will differ based on the sensor and its placement, so you can tell through experimentation what the values mean.

### Other
#### Logger
A Logger is something that takes information that is used and outputs it to some other form - as output either on the driver station console, in the smart-dashboard, or into a file on the RoboRIO.  We typically want to log all sensor information and most output information so that we can be sure that the robot is doing what we tell it to do.  If the robot is not doing what we are telling it to, this makes it easier to determine whether the problem is a hardware problem (electronics, mechanical) or a software problem.

#### LED Lights
We also often use LED lights as an indicator of some kind, or in association with a Vision system that takes advantage of retro-reflective tape.  These are usually controlled with a DigitalOutput in WPILib.

### User Input Devices
#### Joysticks
The joystick is a normal computer joystick, much like you’d find for playing a flight simulator game.  The ones that we have used for the past few years is the Logitech Xtreme 3D Pro, which has 12 buttons, the primary X and Y axis, a Throttle axis, and a directional hat.  Our team typically uses a joystick for the driver’s input method.

#### Button Pads
The button pad is a normal computer button pad.  The ones that we use are a gaming button pad which has 12 buttons.  Our team often uses these for the co-driver’s input method.

#### Dip Switches
Dip Switches are simple toggle switches which are used to switch between different modes.  Our team typically uses them to allow us to select which of several different pre-programmed autonomous routines to use without having to change anything within the code or rely on the smart dashboard.

### Modes
During each match, the first portion is a part called autonomous mode, where the robot drives itself.  The next portion is called teleop mode, where a user drives the robot.

## Robot Code Design
### Robot.java
The "main loop" of the robot is in Robot.java, which has a few entry points from the WPILib infrastructure which our code depends on.  Robot.java typically stays exactly the same from year to year.

The entry points for code execution comes from WPILib at the following times:
* When the robot is first turned on (robotInit)
  * In robotInit, we initialize the mechanisms that the robot will use.
When the robot is enabled in teleop mode (teleopInit)
  * In teleopInit, we initialize the driver as a UserDriver and then run generalInit.  In generalInit we apply the driver to each of the mechanisms.
* When the robot is enabled in autonomous mode (autonomousInit).
  * In autonomousInit, we initialize the driver as an AutonomousDriver, and then call generalInit.
* When the robot is disabled (disableInit).
  * In disabledInit, we call the stop function for each of our mechanisms and the driver.
* Every ~20ms while the robot is enabled in teleop mode (teleopPeriodic).
  * In teleopPeriodic, we simply call our "generalPeriodic" function because we have structured our code to be the same for our teleop and autonomous modes.  In generalPeriodic, we first call the readSensor function for each of our mechanisms, then call update on the driver that is being used in the current mode, and finally call the update function for each of our mechanisms.
* Every ~20ms while the robot is enabled in autonomous mode (autonomousPeriodic).
  * In autonomousPeriodic, we again call "generalPeriodic".

### Mechanisms
Mechanism classes handle the reading of all of the sensors and control of all of the actuators on each mechanism of the robot.  There is one Mechanism class for each individual part of the robot, named using the pattern "ThingMechanism" (where "Thing" is the name of the mechanism, like "DriveTrain").  Mechanisms read from all of the Sensors and translate the Operations from the Driver into the functions that need to be called on the individual Actuators.  This typically involves some math and logic to convert the data from the operations into the particular actions that need to happen.  For example, when using a typical Tank drivetrain, the DriveTrain Mechanism calculates the speed settings to apply to the left and right motors based on the DriveForward operation and the Turn operation.  Also, there may be other concerns to take care of, such as how to respond based on the presence or absence of a setting from another operation or a sensor.  The Mechanisms implement the IMechanism interface which has the definitions of functions that every Mechanism must implement.  In the mechanism, the readSensor and update functions are the most important, and are called every ~20 milliseconds.  The readSensors function reads the current values from all of the sensors and stores them locally in member variables on the object.  The update function calculates what should be applied to the output devices based on the current Operations and the data read from the sensors.  It is important that these functions execute quickly, so anything that depends on a certain length of time elapsing should be calculated between separate runs of update and not involve any sleep operation.  Therefore, most actions that take multiple iterations of the update function belong in a macro instead of being hard-coded into the Mechanism.

### ElectronicsConstants
ElectroincsConstants is a class that holds constant values for all of the physical connections (PWM channels, Digital IO channels, Analog IO channels, CAN ids, etc.) that are needed to be known in order to control the correct output device and read the correct sensors.  We keep this information in a separate class (and all in a single file) so that there is only one place to update if the Electronics sub-team needs to re-run the wiring, or in case there are wiring differences between the practice robot and the competition robot.

### Driver
The Driver is the actor that controls the robots.  The Driver triggers different Operations to occur based on the intent of the current actor that is controlling the robot.  There are two types of Driver - the UserDriver and the AutonomousDriver.

#### Operation
An Operation is a single basic action that the robot can perform.  There are typically many operations for each mechanism.  These operations should be thought of as the most basic ways of controlling each mechanism.  Operations are also the building blocks on top of which we will build out Macros and Autonomous Routines.  Operations can be either Analog or Digital.

##### Analog Operations
Analog operations are typically operations that happen to a certain extent and are controlled by an axis on the joystick during teleop mode (e.g. the drivetrain is controlled by pushing forward along the Y axis of the joystick).  Analog operations are expected to return a double value (rational number, usually between -1.0 and 1.0).

##### Digital Operations
Digital operations are operations that are either happening or not happening and are controlled by a button on the joystick or button pad during teleop mode (e.g. a trigger on the joystick to cause a "shoot" action).  Digital operations are expected to return a boolean value (true or false).

There are three main types of digital operations 
* Simple: which is "true" whenever the button is actively being pressed, and "false" (off) otherwise.  A simple button would typically be used for spinning an intake roller while trying to pick up a ball.
* Toggle: which is "true" from the time that it is first pressed until the next time it is pressed, and then false until it is pressed again.  A toggle button could be used for enabling the vision system, though we often use a click button instead.
* Click: which is true the first time we run an update after each time the button is pressed, and false until the button has been released and pressed again).  A click button would typically be used for shooting a ball or lifting an arm.

#### UserDriver
The UserDriver represents the driver and co-driver operating the robot using joysticks and button pads.  The user driver is in charge of reading from the joysticks and button pads, and then using the ButtonMap schema to translate the individual actions taken on the joystick into Operations and Macro Operations.  The UserDriver is used during Teleop mode.

##### Macros
Macros are groupings of different Operations that need to happen in a certain order and with certain conditions between the various operations.  This is typically done by defining a bunch of individual "tasks" that perform one operation until it has completed, and then composing them together using different types of logic.  One example of a macro would be the extending of the "murder arm" from the 2015 robot.  The murder arm macro could involve 3 operations: extending the arm, opening the rake, and then lowering the arm, each separated by a time delay to ensure that the arm was able to extend before opening the rake.  Another example of a macro from 2018 would be the climb macro, which moved the robot forwards a few inches, raised the elevator to the desired height for the hook to be level with the climbing bar, and then moved the robot backwards so that the hook was placed over the bar.

##### Shifts
Sometimes there aren't enough buttons on the joystick in order to accomodate the number of operations and macros that we want to have available to the Driver.  We have the ability to define "shifts" that allow the same button to mean different things depending on when another button is pressed.  These shifts are described in the ButtonMap along with the Operations.

#### AutonomousDriver
The AutonomousDriver runs the autonomous routine and translates that routine into the set of Operations so that the correct Operations happen at the correct times.  The AutonomousDriver is used during Autonomous mode.

##### Autonomous Routines
Autonomous routines are designed very similarly to macros, except that they are triggered automatically by the autonomous driver instead of by buttons on the joystick.

### TuningConstants
In order to simplify tuning the settings of the robot, we often store settings that we will likely want to change as constants in the TuningConstants class.  Settings that may need to be tuned include things like the speed at which to run an intake, or the speed at which to turn when the joystick is in a certain position.  These settings are usually things that are hard to know in advance, and the appropriate settings are discovered by testing the robot.  There are many things that aren’t known in advance by the software team, so putting all of these things in TuningConstants in an orderly fashion can help speed up the tuning process of the robot.

### HardwareConstants
Similar to the ElectronicsConstants and TuningConstants, we also store some facts about the dimensions of the robot and the different parts of the robot as constants in the HardwareConstants class.  This tends to include things like the diameter of the wheels and the width of the robot, which may be useful for calculations that need to be made during autonomous mode or for differential odometry (which calculates the robot’s position and orientation on the field as compared to the starting position/orientation by using the encoders).

## Instructions
### Making Simple Operation changes
To add a new action that the robot can take with a mechanism, first open the Operation enum (Operation.java) and add a new value to the list in that file under the section for that Mechanism.  It should be named starting with the mechanism (e.g. "DriveTrain", "Intake", etc.), and then a description of the action (e.g. "Turn", "RaiseArm", etc.).  Remember that Operations are a single, simple thing that is done by the robot.  Any more complex action that we want the robot to take will be a Macro which composes these Operations together (which we will talk about later).

Next, you will open the ButtonMap.java file and add another mapping into the OperationSchema that describes the Operation that you just added:
```java
put(
    Operation.IntakeRaiseArm,
    new DigitalOperationDescription(
        UserInputDevice.Driver,
        UserInputDeviceButton.JOYSTICK_STICK_BOTTOM_RIGHT_BUTTON,
        ButtonType.Simple));
put(
    Operation.DriveTrainTurn,
    new AnalogOperationDescription(
        UserInputDevice.Driver,
        AnalogAxis.X,
        ElectronicsConstants.INVERT_Y_AXIS,
        TuningConstants.DRIVETRAIN_Y_DEAD_ZONE));
```

There are two types of operations - Analog or Digital.  Analog operations represent things that are double (decimal) values, typically between -1.0 and 1.0.  Digital operations represent things that are Boolean values (true or false).  Each type, Analog or Digital, has their own type of Description.

The Analog description takes parameters describing the User Input Device (Driver or CoDriver joystick) and the axis of the joystick (X, Y, Throttle, etc.).

The Digital description takes arguments describing the User Input Device, the button on the joystick, and the type of button (Simple, Toggle, or Click).

### Writing a new Mechanism
Mechanisms encapsulate the actuators (e.g. motors, pneumatic solenoids) and sensors (e.g. Encoders, Limit Switches) of each part of the robot.  A mechanism is a class that should be created within a package that you create.  It should be named based on the name of that portion of the robot (e.g. DriveTrain, Intake) like ThingMechanism.  The class should implement the IMechanism interface.

At the top of the class, you should have a list of the definitions of your different actuators and sensors (see the "private final TypeOfActuator nameOfActuator;" and "private final TypeOfSensor nameOfSensor;").  These should be initialized in the constructor (a special function, like you see above) - named like "public ThingMechanism(IWpilibProvider provider)".  For the last 2 years we’ve made use of Google’s Guice to control dependency injection, which is the reason why the special @Inject markup is required.  After the set of actuators and sensors are defined, you will also need to define the driver ("private Driver driver;").  You will then set the value for each actuator and sensor you defined at the top in the constructor by calling the corresponding function on the IWpilibProvider that is passed into the constructor.  These functions will take some number of arguments based on how the actuators/sensors are physically plugged together in the robot.  These arguments should be placed as constants in the ElectronicsConstants file.  We don’t necessarily know in advance how the robot plugs together, so they can be initialized with a value of -1 until we do.

As a part of implementing the IMechanism interface, you will need to have the following three functions in your class:
* ```public void readSensors()```  
  The readSensors function reads from the relevant sensors for that mechanism, stores the results in class member variables, and then logs the results to the logger.
* ```public void update()```  
  The update function examines the inputs from the Driver, and then calculates the various outputs to use applies them to the outputs for the relevant actuators.
* ```public void stop()```  
  Stops any moving piece on the actuators.  This typically means setting any Motor to 0.0 and any DoubleSolenoid to kOff.
* ```public void setDriver(Driver driver)```  
  Sets the driver to use in this class (the implementation of this function should basically just contain "this.driver = driver;").

### Writing Macros and Autonomous Routines
Macros and Autonomous routines both involve control tasks.  These tasks control the robot through setting Operations.  For more advanced tasks, they can read the current state of the robot by running the functions that expose sensors on the Mechanism.

#### Writing Tasks
Tasks implement the IControlTask interface, and typically extend from the ControlTaskBase class.  Tasks should aim to be simple and only accomplish one thing if possible - this helps prevent code duplication later.  An example of a single task is "DriveDistanceTask", which drives forward for a specified distance, or "DriveTimedTask" which drives forward for a specified length of time.

As a part of implementing the IControlTask interface, you will need to have implementations for the following functions in your class (or in a sub-class of your class):
* ```public void begin()```  
  This is called at the very beginning of the task, and can be used to set some initial state.
* ```public void update()```  
  The update function is called every ~20ms and should update the relevant operations.
* ```public void stop()```  
  This function is called when the task needs to be stopped for some reason, allowing state to be cleared and operations to be cancelled.
* ```public void end()```  
  This function is called when the task has ended and should clear any state that needs to be cleared.
* ```public boolean shouldCancel()```  
  This function is called by the driver to check whether something has interrupted the current task such that it shouldn’t continue.  Typically this isn’t used unless there is some sensor being read by the task that would indicate that the task cannot continue.
* ```public boolean hasCompleted()```  
  This function is called by the driver to check whether the particular task should complete.  Often this is based on either the amount of time has elapsed since the task began, or it could be based on some sensor condition being met.

#### Adding Macros
To add a new Macro, you should add a new MacroOperation and MacroOperationDecription to the MacroSchema within ButtonMap.  The MacroOperationDescription requires arguments describing the user input device to use, the button that triggers the macro, a constructor for the task that should be used within the macro, and a list of the different operations that this macro uses.

#### Composing Tasks into Routines
Tasks can be grouped together in interesting ways to describe more complex tasks.  By having tasks happen in a certain order and sometimes simultaneously, you can end up with a routine that performs interesting things.  Some particular tasks you can utilize include:

##### SequentialTask.Sequence()
Sequential task starts and completes each task in the order they are listed.

##### ConcurrentTask.AnyTasks()
Concurrent AnyTasks starts all of the tasks at the same time and completes them when one of them has considered itself to be completed.

##### ConcurrentTask.AllTasks()
Concurrent AllTasks starts all of the tasks at the same time and completes when all of them have considered themselves to be completed.

## Advanced Topics
### PID Controllers
"PID" stands for **P**roportional **I**ntegral and **D**erivative.  PID is a way of controlling a part of a robot that incorporates feedback from sensors in order to control the operation of the robot.  PID is often used as a way for correcting for _error_ caused by things like friction or other forces pushing back on the robot.  PID takes in values according to put in the current _measured value_ (the value discovered from an encoder or other sensor) and _setpoint_ (the desired value).  We typically use PID for elevators and for Positional control in the drivetrain.  For Velocity control we also use Feed-Forward to provide additional control.

With PID, there are different constant values that need to be discovered experimentally for the P, I, D, and F values.  Typically, F is only used for Velocity control.  P is used for basically all PID controllers.  I is used to correct error from slight overshoots or undershoots over time.  D is used to reduce oscillation around the setpoint.  For more information, Wikipedia has an ok article.
